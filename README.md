# SBSA: Size-Based Slot Allocation

**SBSA** is a deterministic, constant-time (`O(1)`) file management model that breaks the traditional `O(log n)` performance barrier imposed by comparison-based data structures like B-trees and skip lists.

This repository contains the theoretical foundation, core implementation, performance benchmarks, and presentation materials demonstrating how SBSA provides predictable, scalable, and mathematically infinite file storage logic.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **O(1)** insert, delete, and lookup — no comparisons needed
- Order-preserving without rebalancing
- Infinite logical capacity via file "thickness" and "dynamic width"
- SSD/NVRAM-aligned structure for real-time applications
- Simpler and faster than traditional ordered data structures

---

## 📘 Core Idea

SBSA uses fixed size classes (`s`) mapped to memory slots (`p`) deterministically:


To support infinite capacity:
- `t ∈ ℕ`: stackable files per slot (thickness)
- `w ∈ ℝ⁺`: dynamically resizable widths

Combined model:


Logical address space becomes:
- Countably infinite: `P × ℕ`
- Uncountably infinite: `P × ℕ × ℝ⁺`

| Structure   | Steps       | Speedup |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| B-tree      | 17,000,000  | 1×      |
| SBSA        | 1,000,000   | 17×     |

## 📢 Final Thought

For over 40 years, the `O(log n)` barrier was considered a limit for ordered storage systems.

**SBSA shows it doesn’t have to be.**

🧊 SBSA Cube — Constant-Time Spatial Memory
SBSA Cube is the foundational logic layer of SBSA. It enables constant-time, multi-key storage by projecting each data point (e.g., task, memory, job) onto six mirrored file paths that form a virtual cube.

Instead of filtering lists or using tree-based lookups, SBSA Cube stores every payload using three orthogonal axes:
